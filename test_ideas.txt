There are some tests that are not easy.

From tclsh, source the panel, and then run
it to to the spot where there is an issue.

To manually run a mesytec command (for usb for example)
try:

serialusb::send $mscfpanel::handle "ds"

or to get the string of all the settings

mscf16::usb::getall $mscfpanel::comhandle

Or... to test that the "rc on/off" is set:

mcfd16::rcbus::execcmd $mcfdpanel::comhandle "re 0 0 73"

Which doesn't seem to matter whether it is set or not (feb2013)!! :(
